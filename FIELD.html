            <h1>SAFE</h1>
            <p>Neurofeedback has decades of research backing its safety and efficacy.</p>
            <h1>EFFECTIVE</h1>
            <p>Like training your muscles, neurofeedback creates changes in your brain, altering and updating the firing patterns and<br>connections in your brain in ways that make you healthier and more balanced.</p>
            <h1>PRIVATE</h1>
            <p>The data we collect is stored on secure servers and the information belongs to you and no one else. It never gets sold to<br>third parties and you can delete it at any time.</p>
            <h1>MAGIC | TRANSFORMATIONAL</h1>

            <h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
            <p>Since your brain is connected to every other system in your body, having a window into its health<br>is critically important. FIELD’s technology works like a dashboard into your brain. Using FIELD's<br>proprietary cap means you can measure your brainwaves - the electricity coming off your brain,<br>which then allows us to make high fidelity calculations about what’s happening throughout your<br>brain and in turn share meaningful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of your brain in<br>memory, learning, language, caring relationships, attention, goal setting, and much more.<br><br>
            But measuring is just the beginning.  What you can measure you can master, and FIELD allows you<br>to do exactly that - master the various aspects of your brain and experience through a simple form<br>of feedback. Neurofeedback empowers you to strengthen the parts of your brain and life most<br>important to you. Neurofeedback works by setting a simple goal for the brain and then giving<br>either audio or visual rewards when the brain performs correctly. Using your goals paired with the<br>power of AI, training is fast and relatively easy, leading to long-term, measurable changes in<br>performance, and overall brain health... all in relation to a life you increasingly love.</p>
